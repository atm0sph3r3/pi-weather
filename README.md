This repo is a Python-based Raspberry Pi project that retrieves the "feels like" temperature from Weather Underground for a supplied zip code and then lights an LED based on that temperature. Ideal and less-than ideal temperatures are specified in the config.ini file in the repo. A Weather Underground API key must be specified as well.


Usage:

python pi.py ZIP_CODE WU_API_KEY
